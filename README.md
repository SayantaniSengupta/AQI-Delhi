# Air Pollution Analysis in Delhi  

## Overview  
This project analyzes air pollution trends in Delhi using time series data of key pollutants. The dataset includes daily concentrations of major pollutants such as CO, NO, NO₂, O₃, SO₂, PM₂.₅, PM₁₀, and NH₃.  

## Key Findings  
- **Seasonal Trends**: Pollutant levels fluctuate significantly across the year, with peaks observed during winter months due to temperature inversion and low dispersion.  
- **Particulate Matter Concerns**: PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀ frequently exceed safe limits, posing severe health risks.  
- **O₃ Variability**: Ozone levels increase during the summer months due to photochemical reactions, while other pollutants show different seasonal patterns.  

## How This Analysis Helps  
- **Policy Decisions**: Helps policymakers identify critical pollution periods and design targeted interventions.  
- **Public Awareness**: Enables citizens to stay informed about air quality trends.  
- **Scientific Research**: Supports further study on the impact of meteorological factors on pollution.
